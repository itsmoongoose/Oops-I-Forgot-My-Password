## __OOPS! I Forgot My Password__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - __OOPS! I Forgot My Password__ is a game where the player attempts to correctly guess the randomly generated password. After each guess, the web page will display a mix of 3 symbols, 1 below each character in the player's guess.

Symbol Explanation:
1. __Green Checkmark__ - The associated character is in the password and in the correct spot
2. __Yellow Question Mark__ - The associated character is in the password, but is not in the correct spot
3. __Red X__ - The associated character is not in the password

Additional Rules:
- The password length will range from 8 to 13 ASCII characters; the total number is not initially displayed to the player, but will become available once they have guessed each character in the password
- Repeated characters are allowed

__*Motivation*__ - Now that the New York Times has introduced a paywall in order to access their games, I became inspired to create a similar puzzle game available to everyone! This also allows me to demonstrate and test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by applying the concepts learned through my program at UofA.
